# AcademiCV
Yet another LaTeX academic CV template...

__Disclaimer__: I take no responsibility if you don't get into your dream grad school, your "safety" grad school, dream job, your "safety" job.

### Features
1. Automatically highlights author name in the publications section.
2. Simple. Clean. I think?
3. Easily switches between left or right side for dates (see the sample PDFs).

### Not-really-features (yet)
1. Does not work with bibliography management (yet). Citations are manual right now.
2. I don't know. Create an issue for any features you want.

### Requires
Compiles with __LuaTeX__. Tested to work well with Overleaf.

### Instruction 
See the pdf files to see how this template looks like (and up to however you want to customize it). The two samples LaTeX files contain good instructions on how use this template. `sample_one` is a template with the dates on the left side, `sample_two` is a template with the dates on the right side.
